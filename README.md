# Stitched-Together
## How to run (Windows)
To run Stitched Together, first ensure that your computer has Python 3 and Node.js installed. 

From the GitHub repository, download the zip of the project.

In a Command Prompt window in the root directory, run the following commands:
```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python init_db.py
cd ..
cd frontend
npm install
```
Once setup is complete, open 2 terminal windows or tabs and activate the virtual environment in each, using `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

In the first terminal, navigate to the backend subdirectory and run `python app.py`

In the second terminal, navigate to the frontend subdirectory and run `npm start`

Stitched Together will then open in your browser, ready to use!
