# Stitched-Together
To run Stitched Together, first ensure that your computer has Python 3 and Node.js installed. 

From the GitHub repository, download the zip of the project.

Inside the root directory are files setup.bat (for Windows) and setup.sh (for Mac). These scripts create and activate the virtual environment venv, install the dependencies in both backend and frontend subdirectories, and run init_db.py to initialize the database. Run the setup script.

Once setup is complete, open 2 terminal windows or tabs and activate the virtual environment in each, using .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat for Windows and source venv/bin/activate for Mac.

In the first terminal, navigate to the backend subdirectory and run python app.py for Windows and python3 app.py for Mac.

In the second terminal, navigate to the frontend subdirectory and run npm start.

Stitched Together will then open in your browser, ready to use!
